   * The net class represents an electrical potential that is shared
   * between electrically adjacent objects.
   *
   * Why do methods in class Net work with object ID instead of
   * shared pointers? There is an automatism. A ConnectedLogicModelObject
   * adds itself to a net, if you set the net for the ConnectedLogicModelObject.
   * And it removes itself from a Net object, if it's destructor is called.
   * The problem is, that the ConnectedLogicModelObject itself only
   * has a \p this pointer. An object can't have a shared pointer to itself.
   * One could work with normal pointers, but this would somehow circumvent
   * shared pointer approach in libdegate. So we use loosely coupled
   * object IDs.
