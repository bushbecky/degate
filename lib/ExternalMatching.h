   * Run an external program, that analyzes images.

   *
   * Here is a brief decription of the result file:
   *
   * Comment lines are starting with a hash mark ('#')
   *
   * Wire:
   *
   * Format: "wire" x1 y1 x2 y2 diameter
   * Example: wire 10 23 100 23 5
   *
   * Via:
   *
   * Format: "via" x y diameter direction
   * Example: via 42 23 5 up
   *
   * The direction is either "up" or "down"
   *
   * Strings are case sensitive.
