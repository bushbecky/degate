degate (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

	* Toggle fullscreen mode with F11
	* Generate verilog code stubs and testbench stubs for standard cells
	* Run a compile test for verilog code stubs directly from the Gate Edit Dialog (requires Icarus Verilog).
	* Run gtkwave directly from the Gate Edit Dialog.
	* Integrated via matching (cross-correlation).
	* Migrated code-base in order to support the new boost::filesystem version 3. Version 2 is still supported, too.

	* Integrated color settings for wires, vias, ... into project settings.
	* Added font size as project setting.
	* Bugfix: Software crashed on opening projects (OS X).

degate (0.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

	* Rewritten rendering engine: it uses OpenGL.
	* Added a jpeg image importer.
	* Several bugfixes
	* Merging of standard cell template images. That will increase the recognition rate and reduces false-positive matches.
	* Added global tile cache manager.
	* template matching improved
	* Implemented interface to use external tools for the wire and via matching.
	* Added library and GUI code to perform Design Rule Checks.

degate (0.0.7) unstable; urgency=low

	* Core completely rewritten in C++. The core is now called libdegate.
	* Degate now uses cmake to build the code.
	* Degate now uses a tile based approach to handle large images.
	* Added basic support for distributed wire tracing.
	* Implemented autosave and restore.
	* Added support for behavioural description of standard cells in VHDL, Verilog and free text.
	* Added support for the autogeneration of VHDL and VHDL testbench code.
	* Support for enabling/disabling and re-ordering of layers added.
	* Annotations (a kind of 2D-boomarks) added.
	* Basic support for module hierarchy added.
	* Support for subprojects added.
	* Basic support for wire matching added.

degate (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

	* improved grid configuration
	* focus removed from quit button and set to image area
	* improved connection inspector
	* gate list / gate selection: sortable rows, more attributes displayed
	* dedicated toolbar icons added
	* open projects via command line
	* added scaling manager: handle prescaled images (bicubical scaling)
	* template matching: select multiple gates for matching, work on scaled images
	* more API documentation
	* project attributes added: project name and project descr.
	* gates and gate ports can have colors - wires and vias too, but there is no UI
	* handling unregular grids
	* naming gate objects by position
	* precompiler macro fix: improved architecture detection (thanks to mazzoo)

degate (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

	* select gate ports
	* inspect connections
	* join/ unjoin objects
	* several Bugfixes, e.g.
	* Write logic model to temp file first and rename it afterwars. This prevents
		data loss, if writing fails.
