Put the file xmlrpc-server-cgi.pl into the directory cgi-bin of
your webserver.

Install these perl modules (under freebsd they are all in the ports tree):

Frontier::RPC2
Data::Dumper
Data::Serializer
Tie::File

Just run the script via command line to check if all required modules
are installed. It will generate a runtime error message, but it should
compile.
